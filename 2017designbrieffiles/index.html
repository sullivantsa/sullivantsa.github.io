		<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 60px">What is Augmented Reality?</h1>
		<p style="color: white; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px; text-align: justify; padding-top: 10px">Augmented reality is the use of electronical information with the environment of the user. Unlike virtual reality, a scripted and programmed environment, augmented reality uses a real environment and "codes" new information to display graphics and figures. Augmented reality applications are written using 3D programs that tie animation or information in the computer program to a location in the real world. When the application receives the location of the device, it begins to execute code and layer the correct image(s).</p>

									<h3 style="color: white; font-size: 35px">Uses and Benefits</h3>
									<h4 style="color: white;">Consumer Uses and Benefits</h4>
									<p style="color: white; margin-right: -600px; text-align: justify; margin-top: -15px">The current "basic layering" concept has a lot of potential. For example, Ikea mobile app you can see how your house might look by buying certain products, or using an app like InkHunter you can see what a tattoo might look like on you. This type of augmented reality is most commonly used. The future of AR could drastically change the world. Augmented reality has the potential of making current technology outdated. Just like computers have made newspapers, magazines and cable TV outed; augmented reality may make televisions, phones, and computers outdated.</p>
									<h4 style="color: white; padding-top: 15px">Military Uses and Benefits</h4>
									<p style="color: white; margin-right: -600px; text-align: justify; margin-top: -15px">The United States Military has increasingly showing interest in augmented reality, especially in training their troops. Augmented Immersive Team Training (AITT) is being practiced to possibly replace most military combat training. Augmented reality allows for realistic images to be generated on top of a trainee's vision acting as a real combat simulator where you move and feel as if you are in actual combat. Using such technology would save thousands of dollars, including ammunation costs, traveling fees, etc.</p>

									<h3 style="color: white; font-size: 35px">Current Technologies</h3>
									<p style="color: white; margin-right: -600px; text-align: justify; margin-top: -15px">Currently, many companies are working furiously to invent and improve current technologies for augmented reality. Not only are they trying to become the first company to claim that they have fully developed a functional augmented reality device, but they are also working to solve problems and find solutions to issues we have never been able to solve before.</p>

									<h3 style="color: white; font-size: 35px">Concerns</h3>
									<p style="color: white; margin-right: -600px; text-align: justify; margin-top: -15px">As with most current technology, augment reality has some technicalities. Augmented reality can create a strain on your eyes. If the device is only a few inches from your face, it can damage your eyesight. Looking at a 2-Dimensional surface for extended periods of time causes your eyes to not re-focus and can have trouble focusing after using augmented reality. Having a screen so close to your face can lead to tunnel vision, central vision loss, diabetic retinopathy, leakage into aqueous humor, or cataracts with long term use. Not only may the device affect your eyes, your privacy might be at stake as well. The manufacturer has the ability to look through a camera or look at the screen you are looking at when you are connected through some form of internet connection. For example, if you are paying a bill using an augmented reality device, your form of payment maybe at risk of being stolen by the company or leaked. Not only can they watch what you see through the device but the company has access to all of your habits, where you walk, and even where you live. Also, distraction in augmented reality can be a big issue and can lead to injury. Looking where you are walking and looking where the augmented reality tells you to go, can be difficult, because it requires multitasking. Looking at directions on where to go can lead to you crossing the street when things are not safe and can lead to injury by an oncoming vehicle.</p>
