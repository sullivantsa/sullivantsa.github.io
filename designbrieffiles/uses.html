                    <strong><p>Today, drones serve multiple purposes for its users. Businesses and the public both profit from drones.</p></strong>
                    <p align="justify" style="padding-right: 65px; padding-left: 65px;"><strong>First we'll take a look at how businesses profit from drones. Businesses use drones to help them get a bigger look at their assets. For example, Real Estate companies use drones to capture aerial photos of properties for sale. This helps the realators visually see the property from above and have a full understanding of what they are dealing with. Aircraft companies and servicing places use drones to do inspections on large aircraft. This allows them to do a quick view all over the aircraft and analyze problems and issues. This allows them to find problems quickly without having to take the time to navigate to the designated area on the exterior of the plane. One of the most important facilities that use drone technologies are Fire and Rescue teams. They use drones when a large helicopter is not safe to navigate around small or dangerous areas. For example, if a camper hiking in a forest found their way into a dangerous situation and needed a rescue, the search and rescue team could use a drone to get a better view and find the camper quickly.</strong></p>
                    <p align="justify" style="padding-right: 65px; padding-left: 65px;"><strong>Now we will take a look at a few personal uses of drone technology. The first example that comes to mind is extreme athletes, from skateboarders to snowboarding, capturing their gnarly moves for the rest of the world to see. This allows the viewers of the videos to literally see the action like never before. </strong></p>
